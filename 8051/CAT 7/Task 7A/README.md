**NAME OF EXP:** 16x2 LCD Driver Development – Task 7A: LCD Initialization and Character/String Display

## TASK 7A: LCD Initialization and Character/String Display

### 1. Circuit Diagram

AT89S52 development board interfaced with a $16\times2$ LCD (HD44780 compatible) configured in 4-bit mode. Control pins (`RS`, `E`) and data pins (`D4`–`D7`) are connected to designated GPIO port pins, with contrast adjusted via a potentiometer. Circuit diagram attached.![Circuit Diagram](circuit.png)

### 2. Core Logic / Pseudocode

1. Include the required 8051 register header file (`reg51.h` / `reg52.h`).
2. Define GPIO pin mappings for control signals (`RS`, `E`) and 4-bit data bus (`D4`–`D7`).
3. Implement a microsecond/millisecond delay routine required for LCD timing compliance.
4. Develop `lcd_cmd(unsigned char cmd)` to send initialization and configuration commands in two 4-bit nibbles.
5. Develop `lcd_data(unsigned char dat)` to send ASCII characters to the LCD DDRAM in two 4-bit nibbles.
6. Implement `lcd_init()` to send the precise HD44780 initialization command sequence: power-on delay, function set ($4\text{-bit}$, $2\text{-line}$, $5\times8\text{ font}$), display control (display ON, cursor/blink settings), entry mode set, and display clear.
7. Write main test logic to display individual characters (e.g., `'A'`) and strings across both rows of the $16\times2$ display.

### 4. Inference

Successfully developed a low-level, bare-metal 4-bit LCD driver for the AT89S52 microcontroller based on the HD44780 datasheet specifications. The LCD was successfully initialized and verified by rendering custom characters and multi-row strings without relying on external libraries.
