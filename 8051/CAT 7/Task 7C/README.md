## TASK 7C: 4x4 Keypad-Based Character Movement

### 1. Circuit Diagram

AT89S52 development board interfaced with a $16\times2$ LCD and a $4\times4$ matrix keypad. Keypad rows and columns are mapped to designated 8051 GPIO ports with software debouncing. Circuit diagram attached.![Circuit Diagram](circuit.png)

### 2. Functional Key Mapped Controls

| Key | Directional Action | DDRAM Coordinate Shift |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2` | Move Up ($\uparrow$) | Row decreases by $1$ (if $\text{row} > 0$) |
| `8` | Move Down ($\downarrow$) | Row increases by $1$ (if $\text{row} < 1$) |
| `4` | Move Left ($\leftarrow$) | Column decreases by $1$ (if $\text{col} > 0$) |
| `6` | Move Right ($\rightarrow$) | Column increases by $1$ (if $\text{col} < 15$) |

### 3. Core Logic / Pseudocode

1. Include the 8051 register header file and integrate the 4-bit LCD driver (`lcd_init`, `lcd_goto`, `lcd_data`).
2. Initialize GPIO ports for scanning the $4\times4$ matrix keypad with switch debouncing logic.
3. Maintain state variables for the current cursor coordinates (`row` initialized to $0$, `column` initialized to $0$).
4. Clear the screen and render a designated tracking character (e.g., `'*'` or `'X'`) at the initial coordinate position `lcd_goto(row, column)`.
5. Continuously scan the keypad in the main loop for valid directional inputs (`2`, `8`, `4`, `6`).
6. Upon detecting a valid key press, erase the previous position, update the `row` or `column` variables within display boundary limits ($0\text{–}1$ for rows, $0\text{–}15$ for columns), and redraw the character at the new coordinate location.

### 5. Inference

Successfully developed an interactive embedded application combining the $4\times4$ keypad and $16\times2$ LCD driver. User inputs from the matrix keypad successfully govern real-time coordinate tracking and character movement across the LCD screen without blocking delays or external helper libraries.
