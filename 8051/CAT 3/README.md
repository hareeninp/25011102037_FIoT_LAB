| CPU Core          | 8-bit 8051                                               |
| Operating Voltage | 5V                                                       |
| Debug Interface   | Multimeter / Programmer interface (board-dependent)      |
| Output Peripherals| 4 LEDs (Digital Outputs)                                 |
| Input Peripheral  | 1 Push-Button Switch (Digital Input with Debouncing)     |
| Mode 0 (Initial)  | All LEDs OFF (`0000`)                                    |
| Mode 1 (Press 1)  | Running LED Pattern (`LED1 → LED2 → LED3 → LED4 → LED1`) |
| Mode 2 (Press 2)  | Binary Counter (`0000` to `1111`)                        |
| Mode 3 (Press 3)  | Alternating Pattern (`1010` ↔ `0101`)                    |
| Mode 4 (Press 4)  | All LED Flash (`1111` ↔ `0000`)                          |

### 3. Core Logic / Pseudocode

1. Include the required 8051 register header file (`reg51.h` / `reg52.h`).
2. Configure the GPIO pins for the four output LEDs and the push-button input.
3. Initialize the system state to `0` (all LEDs OFF).
4. Poll or detect the push-button press event in the main loop.
5. Apply software debouncing delay upon detecting a press to ensure one physical press causes exactly one state transition.
6. Increment and wrap the operating state variable (`1` through `4`).
7. Execute the corresponding LED pattern routine based on the active state (Running LED, Binary Counter, Alternating Pattern, or All-LED Flash).
8. Repeat continuously inside an infinite loop.

### 5. Inference

Successfully designed and implemented a bare-metal, register-level GPIO controller on the AT89S52 microcontroller. Using software switch debouncing and state-machine logic, each valid push-button press cleanly transitions the system across four distinct LED operating modes without external HAL or RTOS libraries.
