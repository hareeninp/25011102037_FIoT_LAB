## TASK B: UART Echo (Interrupt-Driven)

### 1. Circuit Diagram

AT89S52 development board connected to a PC via a USB-to-TTL serial converter. Pin `P3.1` (TXD) connects to the converter's RX pin, pin `P3.0` (RXD) connects to the converter's TX pin, and both share a common GND.

### 2. Core Logic / Pseudocode

1. Include the required 8051 register header file (`reg51.h` / `reg52.h`).
2. Configure Timer 1 in Mode 2 (8-bit auto-reload) using `TMOD = 0x20` and load `TH1 = 0xFD` for 9600 baud with an 11.0592 MHz crystal.
3. Configure `SCON = 0x50` to select 8-bit asynchronous UART (Mode 1) and enable serial reception (`REN = 1`).
4. Enable global interrupts (`EA = 1`) and serial port interrupts (`ES = 1`), then start Timer 1 (`TR1 = 1`).
5. Implement the Serial Interrupt Service Routine (`void serial_ISR(void) interrupt 4`).
6. Inside the ISR, check whether the Receive Interrupt flag (`RI`) is set:
   - Read the incoming character from `SBUF` (or push it into an RX ring buffer).
   - Clear `RI = 0` in software.
   - Write the received byte back to `SBUF` to echo it to the PC terminal.
7. If `TI` triggers inside the ISR, clear `TI = 0` in software to prepare the transmitter for subsequent bytes.
8. Keep the `main()` function running in a non-blocking idle loop while interrupts handle real-time echoing.

### 4. Inference

Successfully developed an interrupt-driven UART echo driver on the AT89S52 microcontroller configured at 9600-8-N-1.

Characters typed in PuTTY (such as `ABC123` and `Hello 8051`) trigger the serial ISR upon arrival, are read from `SBUF`, and are echoed back to the terminal without blocking CPU execution.
